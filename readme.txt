To compile, just run "make -B". Everything is included.



Refractions mostly work.

For recurse*.pov files, the pigment color is rendering to grey for some reason (clipping?)


Images in images/ with renders of
- simple_refract.pov
- recurse_simp.pov
- recurses.pov
- simple_tri.pov
- ugly_part.pov

Some interesting images are in images/interesting/
Most notably, elongated_refract.png and simple_refract_lens.png






done for p2:
	- specular for phong
	- reflections
	- obj transforms
	- cam transforms
	- handin renders of simp_cam and simp_reflect
